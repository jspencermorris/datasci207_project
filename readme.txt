Code in the notebooks directory. The notebooks included are:
    Primary Notebooks:
    -   Image_Classification_Combined: This notebook condenses all the models and functions we built for the image classification models and operationalizes them. Our results (for image classification) are based on the models built in this notebook.
    -   jsm_modeling_tabular.ipynb: This notebook condenses all the models and functions after the foundation for the tabular preprocessing was finished. Our results (for the tabular data) are based on the models built in this notebook.
